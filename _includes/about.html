      I am a Web Developer with a background in Search Engine Optimization [SEO]
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      My interest in web development sparkled the first moment I was exposed to the code during my SEO times. (It all started with optimising H1 tags in raw HTML). Gradually my interest grew so I decided to attend an online coding bootcamp and learn how to think like a developer and how to write good code.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      SEO gave me a great base to build upon my developer skills. Today not only I can build web applications - I can also optimise them for search engines.
