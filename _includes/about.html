      I am a Web Developer with a background in Search Engine Optimization [SEO]
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      My interest in web development sparkled the first moment I was exposed to the code during my SEO times. (It all started with optimising H1 tags in raw HTML). Gradually my interest grew so I decided to attend an online coding bootcamp and learn how to think like a developer and how to write good code.

    <br>
    <p>
      SEO gave me a great base to build upon my developer skills. Today not only I can build web applications - I can also optimise them for search engines.

  </h2>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
    <ul>
      <li>I am a dreamer in my time off, at work - I execute and get things done.</li>
      <li>I actively look for negative feedback - this is one of the fastest ways to learn.</li>
      <li>It is not about who gets the credit (a team should, actually), it is about the result.</li>
      <li>My life and work ethic are summed up in a single Stoic maxim that I live by every day:</li>
      <br>
      <p class="life-quote animated fadeIn">
        “Impediment to action advances action, what stands in the way become the way”
      </p>
      <li>There must be a strategy, if there isn’t one the next step before anything else - should be to devise one.</li>
      <li>Favourite non-fiction book: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations">“Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius</a>.</li>
      <li>Fiction: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Odyssey">Arthur C. Clarke's "Space Odyssey"</a> series.</li>
      <li>I like playing chess and I also speak geek.</li>
