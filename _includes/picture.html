Meanwhile, here are a few things about me:
    </h2>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
  <ul>
    <li>I am a dreamer in my time off, at work - I execute and get things done.</li>
    <li>I actively look for negative feedback - this is one of the fastest ways to learn.</li>
    <li>It is not about who gets the credit (a team should, actually), it is about the result.</li>
    <li>My life and work ethic are summed up in a single Stoic maxim that I live by every day:</li>
  <br>
      <p class="life-quote animated fadeIn">“Impediment to action advances action, what stands in the way become the way”</p>

    <li>There must be a strategy, if there isn’t one the next step before anything else - should be to devise one.</li>
    <li>Favourite non-fiction book: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations">“Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius</a>.</li>
    <li>Fiction: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Odyssey">Arthur C. Clarke's "Space Odyssey"</a> series.</li>
    <li>I like playing chess and I also speak geek.</li>
    <li>:)</li>
  </ul>
